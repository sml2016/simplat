            <h3>Mental Health Therapist</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised in the small village of La Garita, Mexico. I am the seventh of nine children from a very poor family with an 
            alcoholic father. I attended school to sixth grade because that was the highest grade in the closest town. Because of this and poverty no body in the family went to higher education 
            and both of my parent do not know how to write or read. Growing up, I dreamed of having an education however, it was not available to me since we lived in a very small village and poverty. My father did not believe in education and my oldest brothers had to work a few days and go to school the other days of the week in order to finish elementary school and help the family.</p>
            <p>As a teenager, I moved to Guadalajara to work and to help my family.  This is where I saw many young women attending secondary and high school which inspired me to do the same, but coming from a poor background, I believed this to be   impossible for me.  It was not until I was 21 years old that I re-entered school for three more years. I never imagined that  one day I would be able to attend the University and now it is a dream made it a reality; thanks be to God. My desire is to  keep learning and to make a difference in my life, in the life of my family, my church, and the life of others. The generosity of others, the abundance of books, and the opportunities here in the United States, in addition to my perseverance   have made this a reality for me.</p>
             <p>The United States has opened many opportunities to me and I appreciate every single one of them. When I arrived in Chicago at age 26, I did not speak any English, I did not know how to drive, and did not have legal documents. Three years later, I had my residency, was driving, going to school (ESL) full time, and was working full time to support my daughter as a single mom.</p>
             <p>I moved to Arlington, WA, in 1991 and by that time I spoke only Basic English. I starting going to church in English for the first time because there was not any Spanish Mass in this area. I started working full time in a child care along with taking High School classes part time. In 1995, I graduated from High School with High Honors from Everett Community College. In 1998, I became a citizen of the United States. During this time, I worked full time as an interpreter and took evening classes towards an associates of arts degree.</p>
             <p>In February of 2002, I became a full time student after being laid off from work and collecting unemployment. In June 2003, I completed my Associates Transfer Degree at Everett Community College. I started the BASW Program at the University of Washington that same year and graduated in 2005. Then I got into the Advance Standing program and graduated in 2006 with a Master Degree in Clinical Contextual Social Work and a Minor in Dual Diagnosis on Mental Health. Now I am working as a mental Health Therapist for the last nine years where I also have the opportunity to help the Hispanic Community which I love to work with. Three years ago I started a second master at Seattle University on Theology in Pastoral Ministry, MAPS program. I am almost done and very excited about it.</p>
             <p>I support my parents economic in Mexico and lots of family members because there is a great need for basic needs. God has bless me in so many ways like my family, faith, an education, work, and getting to know so many people. This is just a little part of my life of so many blessings that it is hard to name all of them. And thanks be to God.</p>',
