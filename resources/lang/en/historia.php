    'laHistoria' => '<p>Tania Hino and Guillermo Carvajal joined 3 years ago to seek ways to improve the quality of life of the Latino community, especially regarding the challenges of women and their families. Thus arose the idea of ​​a Latin Women’s Symposium. It was their way to implement ideas and years of experience to help the community.</p>  
        <p>Tania and Guillermo met at Northgate Elementary when they worked together on a program called "From Cradle to College” to help children fulfill their college dreams.   In trying to engage the Latino community, the need to start educating parents arose. Parents are vital for encouraging their children to continue their studies after the end of high school; education is a joint ideal that should become a family project.</p>
        <p>Going to college should be the dream of a family where the parents are a fundamental pillar for their children’s academic success.</p>
        <p>With the work they had done with the Latino communities in Seattle, both Tania and Guillermo realized the great responsibility that women have to ensure a better quality of life for their families.  Considering the situations in which these women lived, they came together to begin empowering and inspiring other women to have better lives.</p>
        <p>Mothers assume the primary role in raising their children; therefore, it is they who inspire family members to set higher goals in work and academic areas. With stronger women and better self-esteem everything is possible.</p>
        <p>Tania and Guillermo came to the conclusion that by starting a Latin Women Symposium they could inspire the community to overcome their immigration difficulties and see solutions where before there were problems. Education is the gateway to a better life. Overcoming fear of the education system was one of the main goals.</p>
        <p>Influencing the life of a woman to give her leadership tools means to change completely the life of the whole family, as well as her surrounding community. A woman with dreams and willingness to work hard in order to accomplish her goals is an unstoppable force that pulls along those who are close to her.</p>
        <p>The Latin Women’s Symposium started as a completely free event with 89 participants in its first edition. The second edition was attended by 122 participants and now for the third event we are expecting the participation of 255 women.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the interest shown in the previous two symposia by the Latin women community, Tania and Guillermo have managed to add more women to the project leadership. The first year of the symposium was so successful that several very talented women with years of experience approached Tania to join her in organizing the symposium project. Guillermo remains committed to supporting and giving a hand as an ally to this important initiative for our women.</p>
        <p>Something has to change. Instead of women being behind their partner, why not unify the two and go hand by hand? This is a healthier, richer and more powerful way to realize the dreams of women and their whole families.  A big part of the vision of Latina Women Symposium is giving tools and support to its participants.</p>
        <p>We are hoping that more husbands and children could also collaborate, because women are the pillar that supports their families. Its success is positive and important for everyone.</p>
        <p>Our dream is to organize and gather Latino Women of various cultural, educational and socioeconomic levels to form a community of mutual support. That way we will rise together as a community for a better world.</p>'
